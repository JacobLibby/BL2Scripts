# BL2Scripts
Scripts for Borderlands 2


# Current Status:

Currently, I am in the process of implementing idea 1, which is a cli tool to print out speedrunning records for different categories depending on user input. Right now, output is very disorganized and is mainly used for debugging, which will be updated momentarily to provide a more usable interface.

Packages used are included in _requirements.txt_.



# Ideas for Scripts:
1. Grab current speedrun records and print (https://github.com/speedruncomorg/api, https://github.com/blha303/srcomapi)
2. Enemy --> Drops, drop rates
3. Item --> Rarity, where it is dropped w rates, special features
4. Create gibbed save file for geared speedruns
5. Computer vision deep learning to detect item parts from screen capture


# Running the Scripts:

1. `git clone` the repo
2. `cd` into the directory where the repo is located
3. activate the python virtual environment


## Speedrunning Records Script
4. run `python main.py`
5. Input what category you would like data for (0-10)
